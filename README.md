# 🧾 Form Validation Project

## 📌 Description

This project is a lightweight web application that showcases **client-side form validation** using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's designed to ensure that user inputs are correctly formatted before a form is submitted, providing immediate feedback and improving overall user experience. 

The form includes typical fields like name, email, password, etc., and checks for common input errors such as:

This project is ideal for beginners learning JavaScript or for developers who want a quick validation template for web forms.
